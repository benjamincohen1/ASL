ASL
===

Mapping hand shape to ASL letter since 2013!   Please don't judge me on this code, I know it's a mess!

Dependencies
===
A lot, but the major ones are Numpy, Scipy, PyBrain, PyGame, OpenCV, and SimpleCV

Instructions
===

Simply run asl.py.  Change retrain on line 15 to either train the network from scratch or load from net.xml.  Also this probably won't work for you unless you make a glove like the one in the demo.
